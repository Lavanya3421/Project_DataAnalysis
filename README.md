Insights in this project:-
1. **Dataset Overview**:
   - **Size**: 128,976 rows and 21 columns.
   - Some columns, like `New` and `PendingS`, have no data, and others (e.g., `currency` and `fulfilled-by`) contain missing values.
2. **Sales Trends**:
   - Likely analysis includes top-selling categories, regions (e.g., based on `ship-state` or `ship-city`), and fulfillment methods (`fulfilled-by`).

3. **Order Insights**:
   - Statuses such as "Shipped," "Cancelled," and delivery metrics (`Courier Status`) are critical for understanding fulfillment efficiency.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Common visualizations could include:
     - Sales distribution across categories or regions.
     - Fulfillment method comparison.
     - Time-based trends (if `Date` was analyzed).

Would you like me to perform specific analyses or interpret key findings further?
